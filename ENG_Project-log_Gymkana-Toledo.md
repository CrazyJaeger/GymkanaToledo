# Project log ***Gymkana Toledo***

## Summary
This project is a small and simple web application that uses HTML, JS and CSS that aims to allow a *Gymkana* to take place in the city of Toledo. This was an "express" project, created in a short amount of time (an aproximate amount of 16MH).

## Context
This project's idea was actually a product of my friend Kaelamoran, who was part-taking in an internship as a high school teacher at the time. The class she was working in was going to carry out an excursion to the historical spanish city of Toledo. She had announced that she was going to organize a *Gymkana* style activity for the class, in order to make the visit more fun for the students, giving them an excuse to explore the city at their own pace while carrying out a fun game. This *Gymkana* aimed to guide the students (separated into groups) towards different important buildings in the city using quizzes and puzzles. Once located the building or structure the quizz was referencing, the students had to take a picture of the location with themselves in it in order to prove they had reached the right location.

About a month before the event took place, she was informed that she was not going to be allowed to go to the trip, meaning it would be impossible for her to control the event on site. Apart from this, there was also the issue that it would be difficult to control such a group of people at once, without accidentally giving clues or making a group look for her, thus penalizing their response time. She then came up with the idea of asking me to create a small application to ease the *Gymkana* and allow it to be controlled in a semi-automatic manner, something that became even more important, considering that she wasn't going to be on site during the time it was taking place.

After talking about it, and discovering that *GitHub* allowed users to host small websites, I had the idea of creating a small web application to allow this activity to take place within the boundaries she set. The plan was to create a series of screens that would allow students to read the questions, upload a picture of the location, and allow a teacher to remotely validate the image.

## Project development
This project had a small planning phase with my friend Kaela, who explained her expectations. From this short pase, we identified the following screens:

* A screen for teachers and students to log in
* A screen for students to read the quizzes and upload answers
* A screen for teachers to validate answers
* A screen for a leaderboard showing the student's group classification

Shortly after this conversation, I started working on a crude prototype for this web application. This phase was very slow as I was working with technology that was new to me, in particular, *GitHub's* website publishing. I was also going through a very big transition in my work-life, so I couldn't spend as much time on this project as I would have liked. This situation only got worse when Kaela was informed that she was not going to be able to go to Toledo the day the *Gymkana* was taking place. She sent me the quizzes, clues and solutions during this time, so I could include them in the database whenever I had one.

I eneded up doing a "programming marathon", finishing most of the project in a single night about a weekend before the event took place.
